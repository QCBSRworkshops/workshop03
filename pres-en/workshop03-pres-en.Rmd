La représentation graphique en 3D n'ajoute pas d'informations, elle déforme les proportions de chaque catégorie, de sorte que les catégories du premier plan semblent plus importantes que celles du second plan. 

Les étiquettes de texte ne sont pas non plus suffisamment claires pour être utiles : elles sont petites, empiètent sur le graphique et incluent un pourcentage qui devrait être communiqué par le graphique lui-même. 

Les diagrammes circulaires ne sont pas non plus recommandés car ils s'appuient sur des angles pour représenter la différence entre les parties, mais l'œil humain n'est pas très doué pour lire/interpréter les angles. Nous sommes bien plus aptes à lire les différences d'aire ! Vous trouverez une bonne démonstration du problème des diagrammes circulaires à l'adresse suivante : https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/pie.html.

# Visualization in science
<br>

1. To represent results of statistical analyses
2. To formulate hypotheses and summarize theory
3. To explore your own data (exploratory analysis, outlier detection)
4. To communicate and report
  - Clearly (using good design principles)
  - Precisely and accurately (a plot is worth 1000 words)
  - Effectively and efficiently

# Why use R for graphs?

#### .alert[Because of its powerful features!]

In this workshop, we focus only on `ggplot2`, but [multiple packages and functions](https://insileco.github.io/wiki/rgraphpkgs/) can be used for great visualization (e.g., [`base R`](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/the-base-plotting-system-1.html), [`plotly`](https://plot.ly/r/), [`sjPlot`](http://www.strengejacke.de/sjPlot/), [`mapview`](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/), [`igraph`](https://igraph.org/r/)).

# `ggplot2` is versatile

1. [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package lets you make *beautiful* and customizable plots;
2. it implements the grammar of graphics, a reliable system for building plots.
3. there are [many extensions](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/).

---
# Grammar of Graphics (GG)

GG layers:
- Data
    - your data, in tidy format, will provide ingredients for your plot
    - use `dplyr` techniques to prep data for optimal plotting format
    - usually, one row for every observation that you want to plot

---
# Grammar of Graphics (GG)

GG layers:
- Data
- Aesthetics (aes), to make data visible
    - `x`, `y`: variable along the x and y axis
    - `colour`: color of geoms according to data
    - `fill`: the inside color of the geom
    - `group`: what group a geom belongs to
    - `shape`: the figure used to plot a point
    - `linetype`: the type of line used (solid, dashed, etc)
    - `size`: size scaling for an extra dimension
    - `alpha`: the transparency of the geom

- Aesthetics (aes)
- Geometric objects (geoms)
    * `geom_point()`: scatterplot
    * `geom_line()`: lines connecting points by increasing value of x
    * `geom_path()`: lines connecting points in sequence of appearance
    * `geom_boxplot()`: box and whiskers plot for categorical variables
    * `geom_bar()`: bar charts for categorical x axis
    * `geom_histogram()`: histogram for continuous x axis
    * `geom_violin()`: distribution kernel of data dispersion 
    * `geom_smooth()`: function line based on data

# How to assemble layers in `ggplot2`

1. Create a simple plot object:
  * `plot.object <- ggplot()`

2. Add geometric layers:
  * `plot.object <- plot.object + geom_*()`
  
3. Add appearance layers:
  * `plot.object <- plot.object + coord_*() + theme()`

3. Repeat step 2-3 until satisfied, then print:
  * `plot.object` or `print(plot.object)`

We will be using the `palmerpenguins` dataset.

???

These data were collected from 2007 - 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman with the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program, part of the US Long Term Ecological Research Network.

This dataset is often used to replace the iris dataset, which has some problems for teaching data science, including its ties to eugenics (more on this at https://armchairecology.blog/iris-dataset/).

This dataset was also used for a TidyTuesday challenge, showing the many possibilities of visualising the dataset creatively. For example: [this](https://twitter.com/LauraNavarroSol/status/1289216490307063814?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1289216490307063814%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnsgrantham.shinyapps.io%2Ftidytuesdayrocks%2F), and [this](https://twitter.com/CedScherer/status/1288181995714093057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1288181995714093057%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnsgrantham.shinyapps.io%2Ftidytuesdayrocks%2F).

# Today's dataset: palmerpenguins

Let's take a look at the variables in the penguins dataset:

```{r}
str(penguins)
```

.center[
![:scale 50%](images/culmen_depth.png)
]

???

Note that species, island, and sex are factor variables, which will be important for grouping the data with colour, shapes, etc. in ggplot2. There are then 2 numeric variables (bill measurements depicted in the image), and two integer variables (flipper length and body mass). The data also has a small temporal component, spanning from 2007 to 2009.

---
# Prepare data for `ggplot2`

`ggplot2` requires you to prepare the data as an object of class `data.frame` or `tibble` (common in the `tidyverse`).

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(tibble)
class(penguins) # all set!

peng <- as_tibble(penguins) # acceptable
class(peng)
```

**&#x267B; Recall from the [*Loading and manipulating data*](https://qcbsrworkshops.github.io/workshop02/pres-en/workshop02-pres-en.html#1) workshop**:

More complex plots in `ggplot` require the long data frame format.

# Scientific questions about penguins

.center[
![:scale 50%](images/culmen_depth.png)
]

.center[**Scientific questions**]
<br>
- Is there a relationship between the **length** & the **depth** of bills?
- Does the size of the **bill & flipper** vary together ?
- How are these measures distributed among the **3 penguin species** ?

.center[.alert[How can we graphically address these questions with `ggplot`?]]

---
# Exploring data structure

<!-- Explain the databases before the examples  -->

```{r, fig.width = 10.25, fig.height = 6.5}
ggpairs(penguins, aes(colour = species)) + theme_bw()
```

???
ggpairs is in the GGally package (loaded and installed in the beginning of the workshop)
note: _ggpairs (ggplot version of psych package) allows us to explore correlations in data_

We can already see some species groupings between bill length and bill depth, flipper length, and body mass. When plotting, it will be important to keep in mind that differentiating species might be important.

---
# Exploring data structure

Let's explore how some of this data is structured by species:

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.height=7, fig.width=9, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,               # Data
       aes(x = bill_length_mm,        # Your X-value
           y = bill_depth_mm,         # Your Y-value
           col = species)) +          # Aesthetics
  geom_point(size = 5, alpha = 0.8) + # Point
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +        # Linear regression
  labs(title = "Relationship between bill length and depth\nfor different penguin species", # Title
       x = "Bill length (mm)",
       y = "Bill depth (mm)",
       col = "Species") + 
  theme_classic() + # apply a clean theme
  theme(title = element_text(size = 18, face = "bold"),
      text = element_text(size = 16))
```

.small[&#x267B; See [*Loading and manipulating data workshop*](https://qcbsrworkshops.github.io/workshop02/pres-en/workshop02-pres-en.html#1) to learn how to clean your dataset.]

???

Take the time to explain each line of this plot code (especially the aesthetics and the geoms), and what it tells us.
For example, by differentiating species, we can see that there is a pretty consistent relationship between bill length and depth across species (similar slopes), but that the ranges of these variables is different (the groupings are clearly shown by the colours). Adelie penguins tend to have smaller bill length but fairly large bill depth, while the inverse is true for Gentoo penguins.

scale_colour_manual() and scale_fill_manual() allow you to choose your own colour values, but it's important to still make sure these colours are a good choice (clarity, colorblind-friendly, etc.). More on this in a few slides!

# Use colourblind-friendly palettes

Have you ever considered how your figure might appear under various forms of colourblindness?
We can use the package [colorblindr](https://github.com/clauswilke/colorblindr) to consider this. This package is not currently on CRAN, so we install it with the packages [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/remotes/index.html).

```{R colorblindr_install, message = FALSE}
#install.packages("remotes", quiet = TRUE)
remotes::install_github("clauswilke/colorblindr@cc54c8a35f8e7689ef4cc128b0da3af92f8cd540", quiet = TRUE)
library(colorblindr)
```

The long string of numbers are letters are the GitHub SHA code for a specific version of this package, because recent commits have broken the installation. This is not important for the participants to know, but might be worth explaning briefly to avoid confusion about this installation.

???

Note that setting many variables to visual cues like color, shape, size, and alpha at once tends to be overwhelming for the viewer. Adding 4 levels of complexity on top of the 2-dimensional representation of points can be too much to process properly. It is better to choose the visual cues and key variables for the desired message than to overload a plot with every possibility in the aes() function.

A scatter plot is a great way to visualize data points for two variables. Two aesthetics are required in `geom_point()`: the `x` and `y` variables.

It can, however, be difficult to discern any potential relationship in a scatter plot. You can use `geom_smooth()` to fit a line through your data with a variety of methods. Here, we will add a linear fit to the scatter plot.

Boxplots are a popular way to plot the distribution of data across some grouping variable, like species. You can specify this grouping variable in  `aes()` using `group =`, or the aesthetics used to represent the data (`fill =`, `col = `, `shape = `) to generate the boxplot.

Though boxplots are very popular to summarise data, someone looking at your plot may not intuitively grasp how this summary works and what it might be hiding. Using boxplots well requires an understanding of their anatomy, as seen below. More on the pitfalls of boxplots [here](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/boxplot.html).

To help boxplots speak for themselves, we can add annotations with `geom_signif()`. The function `geom_signif()` calculates the significance of a difference between groups and adds the annotation to the plot in a single line.

# Violin plot: `geom_violin()`

As explained on https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/violin.html

> Violin plot allows to visualize the distribution of a numeric variable for one or several groups. [...] It is really close to a boxplot, but allows a deeper understanding of the distribution.

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4.5}
# Data
names <- c(rep("A", 80) , rep("B", 50) , rep("C", 70))
value <- c(sample(2:5, 80 ,replace=TRUE), sample(4:10, 50 , replace=TRUE),
       sample(1:7, 70 , replace=TRUE))
data <- data.frame(names,value)

#Graph

ggplot(data = data, aes(names, value, fill=names)) + geom_violin()

Like boxplots, violin plots visualise the distribution of a numeric variable for one or several groups. However, a violin's shape represents the distribution of points that is obscured in a boxplot's summarisation, allowing for a more accurate representation of the data ([Data-to-Viz)](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/violin.html)).

Let us compare a boxplot and a violin plot on some generated data. Notice how the violin plot *shows* us the range **and** the variability in our data, while the boxplot cannot communicate these two things as intuitively.

# Violin plot: `geom_violin()`

```{r, fig.align="center"}
violin <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
                 aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, fill = "grey70", alpha = .5) +
  labs(title = "Violin plot")
violin

# Violin plot: `geom_violin()` + `_boxplot()` + `_jitter()`

```{r, fig.align="center"}
violin + 
    geom_jitter(shape = 16, position = position_jitter(0.2),
              alpha = .3)+
  geom_boxplot(width = .05)
```

???
Although we have a good idea of how the data is distributed, we can enhance the plot by visualising some summary statistics and the data points. Let us plot a boxplot and the data points *on top* of our violin plot with `geom_violin()` + `geom_boxplot()` + `geom_jitter()`.

(peng.dens <- ggplot(penguins, 
                     aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +

   geom_density())

Wrapping the plot objects in () prints them whenever these lines are run, rather than printing the plot object on another line as we have been doing.

# Dendogram: `ggdendrogram()`

Which US states have similar arrest rates?

```{r, fig.height = 4}
library(ggdendro)
USArrests.short <- USArrests[1:10,] # take a small sample for simplicity
hc <- hclust(dist(USArrests.short), "average") # cluster by average distance (UPGMA)

ggdendrogram(hc, rotate = TRUE)

# Arrange plots: `patchwork`

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(patchwork)
peng.dens + cars.dens +
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'a') # adds a) and b) to your plots, to reference
# in your figure captions.
```

???

We have used facets to split our plot into multiple windows. However, this is restricted to plotting the same variables from the same dataset. The `patchwork` package makes it easy to arrange separate ggplots together in one frame with `+` (arrange plots beside each other), `/` (arrange one plot on top of the other), `()` (group this arrangement of plots)  as though you are writing an equation. You can demo variations of this arrangement live.

# Miscellaneous: interactive plots using `plotly()`

ggplotly(p)

The `plotly()` library contains the function `ggplotly()`, which translates your `ggplot` code into an interactive `plotly` object in one line of code.

You can click on the species in the legend to add/remove species. You can also see values while hovering over points.

# Saving plots in code

`ggsave()` writes directly to your working directory and allows you to specify the name of the file, the dimensions of the plot, the resolution, etc.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my1rstPlot <- 
  ggplot(penguins, 
         aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
             y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point()

ggsave("my1stPlot.pdf",
       my1rstPlot,
       height = 8.5, width = 11, units = "in", res = 300)
```

NB: Vectors (e.g., pdf, svg) format are more flexible than raster format (jpeg,
png, ...) if the image needs modification afterwards.

**Tip:** `quartz()` (mac) or `window()` (pc) functions make sizing easier before `ggsave()`!

???

Tip:`quartz()` (mac) or `window()` (pc) functions make sizing easier before `ggsave()`! Just plot your ggplot in quartz() or window(), adjust the size until it looks good, and run ggsave() with the filename to see which dimensions you used! You can then add this in your code with height = and width = as shown above. You can demo this.
