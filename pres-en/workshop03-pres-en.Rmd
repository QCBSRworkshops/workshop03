#### What makes an effective visualization?

How could we improve this figure ![:faic](arrow-up)?


???

Plotting this in 3D is not adding information, it is distorting the proportions of each category so the ones in the foreground look more important than those in the back. 

The text labels are also not clear enough to be useful: they are small, overlap with the pie chart, and also include a percentage that should be communicated by the plot itself. 

Pie charts are also not recommended because they rely on angles to represent the difference between parts, but the human eye is not very good at reading/interpreting angles. We are much better at reading differences in area! There is a good demonstration of the pie chart problem here: https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/pie.html.

# Visualization in science
<br>

1. To represent results of statistical analyses
2. To formulate hypotheses and summarize theory
3. To explore your own data (exploratory analysis, outlier detection)
4. To communicate and report
  - Clearly (using good design principles)
  - Precisely and accurately (a plot is worth 1000 words)
  - Effectively and efficiently

# Why R for graphs?

#### .alert[ Because of its powerful features!]

In this workshop, we focus only on `ggplot2`, but [multiple packages and functions](https://insileco.github.io/wiki/rgraphpkgs/) can be used for great visualization (e.g., [`base R`](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/the-base-plotting-system-1.html), [`plotly`](https://plot.ly/r/), [`sjPlot`](http://www.strengejacke.de/sjPlot/), [`mapview`](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/), [`igraph`](https://igraph.org/r/)).

# `ggplot2` is versatile

1. [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package lets you make *beautiful* and customizable plots;
2. it implements the grammar of graphics, a reliable system for building plots.
3. it [has many extensions](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/).

# Grammar of Graphics (GG)

GG layers:
- Data
    - your data, in tidy format, will provide ingredients for your plot
    - use `dplyr` techniques to prep data for optimal plotting format
    - usually, one row for every observation that you want to plot

---
# Grammar of Graphics (GG)

GG layers:
- Data
- Aesthetics (aes), to make data visible
    - `x`, `y`: variable along the x and y axis
    - `colour`: color of geoms according to data
    - `fill`: the inside color of the geom
    - `group`: what group a geom belongs to
    - `shape`: the figure used to plot a point
    - `linetype`: the type of line used (solid, dashed, etc)
    - `size`: size scaling for an extra dimension
    - `alpha`: the transparency of the geom

- Aesthetics (aes)
- Geometric objects (geoms)

    * `geom_path()`: lines connecting points in sequence of appearance
    * `geom_boxplot()`: box and whiskers plot for categorical variables
    * `geom_bar()`: bar charts for categorical x axis
    * `geom_histogram()`: histogram for continuous x axis

# How layers in `ggplot2` works

1. Create a simple plot object:
  * `plot.object <- ggplot()`

2. Add geometric layers:
  * `plot.object <- plot.object + geom_*()`
  
3. Add appearance layers:
  * `plot.object <- plot.object + coord_*() + theme()`

3. Repeat step 2-3 until satisfied, then print:
  * `plot.object` or `print(plot.object)`

???

These data were collected from 2007 - 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman with the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program, part of the US Long Term Ecological Research Network.

This dataset is often being used to replace the iris dataset, which has some problems for teaching data science, including its ties to eugenics (more on this at https://armchairecology.blog/iris-dataset/).

This dataset was also used for a TidyTuesday challenge, showing the many possibilities of visualising the dataset creatively. For example: [this](https://twitter.com/LauraNavarroSol/status/1289216490307063814?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1289216490307063814%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnsgrantham.shinyapps.io%2Ftidytuesdayrocks%2F), and [this](https://twitter.com/CedScherer/status/1288181995714093057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1288181995714093057%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnsgrantham.shinyapps.io%2Ftidytuesdayrocks%2F).

# Today's dataset: palmerpenguins

Let's take a look at the variables in the penguins dataset:

```{r}
str(penguins)
```

.center[
![:scale 50%](images/culmen_depth.png)
]

???

Note that species, island, and sex are factor variables, which will be important for grouping the data with colour, shapes, etc. in ggplot2. There are then 2 numeric variables (bill measurements depicted in the image), and two integer variables (flipper length and body mass). The data also has a small temporal component, spanning from 2007 to 2009.

---
# Prepare data for `ggplot2`

`ggplot2` requires you to prepare the data as an object of class `data.frame` or `tibble` (common in the `tidyverse`).

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(tibble)
class(penguins) # all set!

peng <- as_tibble(penguins) # acceptable
class(peng)
```

**&#x267B; Recall from the [*Loading and manipulating data*](https://qcbsrworkshops.github.io/workshop02/pres-en/workshop02-pres-en.html#1) workshop**:

More complex plots in `ggplot` require the long data frame format.

# Scientific questions about penguins

.center[
![:scale 50%](images/culmen_depth.png)
]

.center[**Scientific questions**]
<br>
- Is there a relationship between the **length** & the **depth** of bills?
- Does the size of the **bill & flipper** vary together ?
- How are these measures distributed among the **3 penguin species** ?

.center[.alert[How can we graphically address these questions with `ggplot`?]]

---
# Exploring data structure

<!-- Explain the databases before the examples  -->

```{r, fig.width = 10.25, fig.height = 6.5}
ggpairs(penguins, aes(colour = species)) + theme_bw()
```

???
ggpairs is in the GGally package (loaded and installed in the beginning of the workshop)
note: _ggpairs (ggplot version of psych package) allows us to explore correlations in data_

We can already see some species groupings between bill length and bill depth, flipper length, and body mass. When plotting, it will be important to keep in mind that differentiating species might be important.

---
# Exploring data structure

Let's explore how some of this data is structured by species:

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.height=7, fig.width=9, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,               # Data
       aes(x = bill_length_mm,        # Your X-value
           y = bill_depth_mm,         # Your Y-value
           col = species)) +          # Aesthetics
  geom_point(size = 5, alpha = 0.8) + # Point
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +        # Linear regression
  labs(title = "Relationship between bill length and depth\nfor different penguin species", # Title
       x = "Bill length (mm)",
       y = "Bill depth (mm)",
       col = "Species") + 
  theme_classic() + # apply a clean theme
  theme(title = element_text(size = 18, face = "bold"),
      text = element_text(size = 16))
```

.small[&#x267B; See [*Loading and manipulating data workshop*](https://qcbsrworkshops.github.io/workshop02/pres-en/workshop02-pres-en.html#1) to learn how to clean your dataset.]

???

Take the time to explain each line of this plot code (especially the aesthetics and the geoms), and what it tells us.
For example, by differentiating species, we can see that there is a pretty consistent relationship between bill length and depth across species (similar slopes), but that the ranges of these variables is different (the groupings are clearly shown by the colours). Adelie penguins tend to have smaller bill length but fairly large bill depth, while the inverse is true for Gentoo penguins.

           y = bill_depth_mm,         # Your Y-value

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=6}

???

theme_classic() was applied to all plots in the presentation to help with clarity using theme_set at the beginning of this slide deck, so these plots do not have the ggplot2 default grey background. There is a section about themes later in the presentation, but it is a good idea to mention that a theme has been applied to remove the default background, which the participants might see if they run the code chunks themselves as they follow along.

# `ggplot()` dynamics: aesthetics layer

scale_colour_manual() and scale_fill_manual() allow you to choose your own colour values, but it's important to still make sure these colours are a good choice (clarity, colorblind-friendly, etc.). More on this in a few slides!

# Use colourblind-friendly palettes

Have you ever considered how your figure might appear under various forms of colourblindness?
We can use the package [colorblindr](https://github.com/clauswilke/colorblindr) to consider this. This package is not currently on CRAN, so we install it with the packages [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/remotes/index.html).

```{R colorblindr_install, message = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes", quiet = TRUE)
remotes::install_github("clauswilke/colorblindr@1d0d5afef105df0f97715fcdd67f3203a383a2dc", quiet = TRUE)
library(colorblindr)
```

The long string of numbers are letters are the GitHub SHA code for a specific version of this package, because recent commits have broken the installation. This is not important for the participants to know, but might be worth explaning briefly to avoid confusion about this installation.

???

Note that setting many variables to visual cues like color, shape, size, and alpha at once tends to be overwhelming for the viewer. Adding 4 levels of complexity on top of the 2-dimensional representation of points can be too much to process properly. It is better to choose the visual cues and key variables for the desired message than to overload a plot with every possibility in the aes() function.

# Violin plot: `geom_violin()`

As explained on https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/violin.html

> Violin plot allows to visualize the distribution of a numeric variable for one or several groups. [...] It is really close to a boxplot, but allows a deeper understanding of the distribution.

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4.5}
# Data
names <- c(rep("A", 80) , rep("B", 50) , rep("C", 70))
value <- c(sample(2:5, 80 ,replace=TRUE), sample(4:10, 50 , replace=TRUE),
       sample(1:7, 70 , replace=TRUE))
data <- data.frame(names,value)

#Graph
qplot(x=names ,y=value ,data=data ,geom=c("boxplot","jitter") ,fill=names)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(data = data, aes(names, value, fill=names)) + geom_violin()

```
]

# Violin plot: `geom_violin()`

```{r, fig.align="center"}
violin <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
                 aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, fill = "grey70", alpha = .5) +
  labs(title = "Violin plot")
violin
```

---
# Violin plot: `geom_violin()` + `_boxplot()` + `_jitter()`

```{r, fig.align="center"}
violin + 
    geom_jitter(shape = 16, position = position_jitter(0.2),
              alpha = .3)+
  geom_boxplot(width = .05)
```

???
note: Multiple geoms can be used together! The order determines how they overlap.

# Summarise y values: `stat_summary()`

.pull-left[
```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=4}
ggplot(mtcars, 
       aes(cyl, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_summary(fun.y = "median", 
               geom = "point",
               colour = "red",
               size = 6) +

# Representing maps: `geom_map()`
.small[
```{r}
crimes <- data.frame(state = tolower(rownames(USArrests)), USArrests)
crimesm <- reshape2::melt(crimes, id = 1)

library(maps)

ggplot(crimes, aes(map_id = state)) +
  geom_map(aes(fill = Murder), map = states_map) +
  expand_limits(x = states_map$long, y = states_map$lat) +
  coord_map()

## Density plots: `geom_density()`

.small[A density plot shows the distribution of a numerical variable and it takes only set of numeric values as input.]
.pull-left[
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4.4}
(peng.dens <- 
   ggplot(penguins, 
          aes(bill_length_mm)) +
   geom_density())
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4.4}
(cars.dens <- 
   ggplot(cars, aes(dist)) +
   geom_density())
```
]

---
# Dendogram: `ggdendrogram()`

```{r}
library(ggdendro)
USArrests.short = USArrests[1:10,]
hc <- hclust(dist(USArrests.short), "ave")

ggdendrogram(hc, rotate = TRUE, theme_dendro = FALSE)
```


---
# Arrange plots: `patchwork`

**Add multiple graphs on the same plot**

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(patchwork)
peng.dens + cars.dens +
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'a')
```

## Miscellaneous: interactive plots using `plotly()`
.small[
.alert[**Select the species data to display directly from the legend**]

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
p <- ggplot(penguins,
           aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, 
               colour = species, shape = species)) +
    geom_point(size=6, alpha=0.6)
# convert to a plotly object!
plotly::ggplotly(p)
```
]

???

You can click on the species in the legend to add/remove species. You can also see values while hovering over points.

# Saving plots in code

`ggsave()` writes directly to your working directory and allows you to specify the name of the file, the dimensions of the plot, the resolution, etc.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my1rstPlot <- 
  ggplot(penguins, 
         aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
             y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point()

ggsave("my1stPlot.pdf",
       my1rstPlot,
       height = 8.5, width = 11, units = "in", res = 300)
```

NB: Vectors (e.g., pdf, svg) format are more flexible than raster format (jpeg,
png, ...) if the image needs modification afterwards.

# Saving plots in code
<br>

Other methods to save image: see `?pdf` `?jpeg`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pdf("./graph_du_jour.pdf")
  print(my1rstPlot) # print function is necessary
graphics.off()
```

# Saving plots in code

**Tip:** `quartz()` (mac) or `window()` (pc) functions make sizing easier before `ggsave()`!

???

note: _this function allows to resize plot live, then use ggsave without specifying plot._

# Concluding remarks
<br>

  1. There are other useful packages that can be used with `ggplot2`! To name a few: `ggbio`, `ggpmisc`, `geomnet`, `gganimate`, `ggnetwork` and `ggtree`. Have a look at [www.ggplot2-exts.org](https://www.ggplot2-exts.org/) for other `ggplot2` extensions.


  2. Note that you can learn more about design and image manipulation with the "Introduction to graphic design and image manipulation with open source tools": https://qcbs.ca/wiki/graphics
